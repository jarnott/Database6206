All of the above is to be presented in class, and submitted to DC Connect as your first interim report.  You will present your plan to Stephen, with your group, not to the whole class, ensuring that all group members are in attendance.

~~ DELIVERABLE 2: Draft 3NF & Application Design ~~
Draft 3NF, application design (ex. Wireframe or form design) and an updated .mpp file indicating your project progress, be sure to include your “who does what” report. 

~~ DELIVERABLE 3: Proposal Presentation & Report ~~
Final formal report/proposal and proposal and beta application presentation.  Your proposal “hard copy” is to be handed in, in class, prior to your group’s presentation.  You will be presenting to Stephen and invited guests.  You will want to ensure that your application’s main functionality is performing properly so to leave the clients (their representatives) with a comfortable feeling that you are on track for delivery of the application one week hence.

~~ DELIVERABLE 4: Database & Application ~~
Submit to DC Connect your actual database and application as your final case submission.  In the case of a web application, dependant on the technology, you may have to simply submit your URL.  You also need to submit your final .mpp file and reports to DC Connect.
